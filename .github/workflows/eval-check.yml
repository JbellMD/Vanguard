# Example CI gate for Vanguard AI Eval Platform
#
# - Set `API_URL` as a GitHub Actions secret pointing at your deployed backend,
#   e.g. https://api.example.com
# - Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a GitHub Actions secret for the judge model.
#
# To switch to running the backend via docker-compose in CI instead of using a
# deployed URL, replace the `API_URL` environment variable with the local
# compose endpoint and add a `docker compose up` step.
